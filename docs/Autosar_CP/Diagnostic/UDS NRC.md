The CAN-TP has 4096 bytes has a maximum length, if the server will send more than that, then this NRC will be sent by the server to the client. Ex: suppose you requested more number of DIDs at a time to read the data if it will cross that limit, then this NRC will get generated by the server.                                                                                                                                 |

One client has already requested a service that is under process means incomplete and the second client is requesting another request to the server then the server will send the NRC 0x21 to the second server to wait for some time. This time will be defined in the document that you need to check. |

So that the Gateway ECU will send this request to the target ECU and that should perform the operation and send back the response message to the Gateway ECU, and then it will send the response message. If the Gateway ECU does not receive the response message from that target ECU or server then the Gateway ECU will send this NRC to the client.  <br>This NRC supported by each SID.                                                                    |
